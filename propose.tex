\section{Problem Description}
Half of genetic informaiton is passed down from parents to children. If looking
at family photos, human eyes could easily tell the simliarity faces. As
computer vision performance developed, we could use deep learning to recognise
the kinship. Possible applications could be missing-children and parents
matching, personal photos sharing among families, socal networking apps,
searching lost sibling/relatives, crime investigation. We are going to build a
model to classify whether two faces are parents-child, sibling, or not related.

\section{Challenges}
It might be hard to achieve higher accuracy since people without any family
kinship would look simliar to each other. There are other metrics that we could
consider to determine if the kinship exists. Such information includes hands
shape, nail types, foot toes, ears, hairs. Due to time limitation and team
size, we aren't able to collect this data. Otherwise the prediction would
improve a lot.

\section{Dataset}
We are going to use Families In The Wild (FIW) Database. FIW is the largest and
most comprehensive database available for kinship recognition. It is made up of
11,932 natural family photos of 1,000 families. It includes 656,954 image pairs
divided into parent-child pair-wise types -- father-daughter (F-D), father-son
(F-S), mother-daughter (M-D), mother-son (M-S) and siblings pairs types --
brother-brother (B-B), sister-sister (S-S).

There are another smaller family dataset KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II, which
includes 533 pairs of parent-child type images.

We divided 95 of the images as training set, 5 percent as test set.

\section{Models and Evaluation}
we use multi-classifier to indicate what the kinship between two faces is. The
output layer we choose is softmax layer of {parents-children, siblings, no-relationship}.  We
choose triplets image training function.

Face model I choose to use VGG-Face model FaceNet
